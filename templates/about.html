        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>ðŸš€ Welcome to my free Data Science learning platform! My goal is to provide masterâ€™s level knowledge in Data Science for free to all students worldwide. They are many courses online that provides
            knowledge in Data Science but they are not free. I want to provide the same knowledge for free. </p> <p>I want to make high-quality education accessible to everyone through video tutorials, hands-on Jupyter Notebooks, and interactive projects.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Why This Initiative?</h3>
        <p>Many students struggle to afford a formal Data Science degree. With this platform, I aim to make high-quality education accessible to everyone through <b>video tutorials</b>, <b>hands-on Jupyter Notebooks</b>, and <b>interactive projects</b>.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h3>What Youâ€™ll Learn</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering</li>
            <li>ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Algorithms (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)</li>
            <li>ðŸ“ˆ Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI</li>
            <li>ðŸ’¡ Real-World AI Applications</li>
